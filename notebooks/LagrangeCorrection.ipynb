    "In discussing Lagrange interpolation, we introduced the convenience of using packages such as Polynomials.jl for automating our computation of polynomial interpolants. We used the `fit` function available through Polynomials.jl to obtain our interpolant, but this was a mistake. In fact, what `Polynomials.fit` _actually_ does is least squares fitting, **not** interpolation. This means that while the approximation generated will, on average, be close to the data points so as to minimize least-squares error, it will **not** generally interpolate the data; that is, it will not pass through the data points exactly.\n",

    "Notice that for sufficiently large $n$, the least squares model actually fails to interpolate the underlying function (so as to minimize error away from the mesh), whereas the Lagrange interpolant will actually interpolate _all_ of the nodes, even if performance suffers away from the mesh.\n",
