This produces a higher-order approximation (quadratic in $h$ instead of linear in $h$), and is expressed in equation (4.5) of section 4.1 in the textbook. If you take MATH301 next quarter, you may see centered differences used to discretize first derivatives in ODE problems, as it will (sometimes) allow for higher-order approximations in space, and they may also come up in the numerical discretization of Neumann (or periodic) boundary conditions for basic numerical PDEs (although you may need to introduce a \"ghost point\")."
